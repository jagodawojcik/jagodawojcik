# 👋👋👋

I’m a Full-stack Software Engineer with a strong backend focus.
I build cloud-native systems ☁️, high-performance backend services 🏃, and end-to-end features across C++, Python, TypeScript, and React 🕸️.
Currently building cool things for autonomous driving at Oxa. 🚙🚀

AI, robotics, and embedded systems were part of my academic past 😄 — today my work revolves around:

- Backend-leaning full-stack engineering

- Cloud-native architectures & serverless systems

- Automated ML/Data pipelines

- High-performance C++ and Python services

- Cloud infrastructure, scalability, and automation

- CI/CD and developer tooling

Most of my work happens in a private GitLab,
so this profile is quieter than reality. 😉
